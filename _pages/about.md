Hi! I am a PhD student in the theoretical computer science group of Rutgers University, advised by Karthik CS. I work on satisfiability algorithms and their connections to circuit lower bounds and fine grained complexity. 

Previously, I completed my Bachelors and Masters in Mathematics from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Pune.
